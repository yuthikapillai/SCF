spincube: The spin density code helps plot spin densities along x y and z spin axes. It generates the cube files asociated with each spin density direction.  It only needs the coefficients/density matrix supplied to it.

coefficients.py: Generates the fock matrix using coefficients, one and two electron integral matrices.
